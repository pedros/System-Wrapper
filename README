NAME
    System::Wrapper - Class-wrapped system calls and qx operator

VERSION
    This document describes System::Wrapper version 0.0.1

SYNOPSIS
        use System::Wrapper;

        my $command = System::Wrapper->new();

        $command->interpreter( 'perl');
        $command->executable( 'program.pl');
        $command->arguments( [ 'first', {second_a => 2, second_b => 2}, {third => [1,2,3]} ] );
        $command->input( \@ARGV );
        $command->output( { '--output' => 'file'}, q{>} => 'file2' );
        $command->path( [$command->path, q{.}] );
        $command->capture = 1;
        $command->verbose = 1;
        print $command->command;
        $command->run;

DESCRIPTION
     This module wraps perl's C<system> call and c<qx> operator in an object-oriented
     interface. It provides utility methods for accomplishing things that are not very
     simple in C<system> and C<qx>. This includes in-situ I/O and call success via
     temporary filenames, C<system> call progress estimation, finding whether the
     executable and-or interpreter are on the path, validating filenames, cross-platform
     output operators and argument type specification.

     This module can be used as a generic wrapper around C<system> and C<qx>, or as
     a base class for building interfaces to utilities not available to C<perl> itself.

        available.

        Default "literal": *true*. Return non-literal matches.

        If the suggester is enabled, you can tell it to return the best
        match with "useSuggest=true" and "literal=false".

    phrases($word, %args)
        You can fetch interesting bi-gram phrases containing a word. The
        "mi" and "wlmi" elements refer to "mutual information" and "weighted
        mutual information" and will be explained in detail via future blog
        post. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#phrases>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "count": *5*. Specify the number of results returned.

    definitions($word, %args)
        Definitions for words are available from Wordnik's keying of the
        Century Dictionary and parse of the Webster GCIDE. The Dictionary
        Model XSD is available in
        <http://github.com/wordnik/api-examples/blob/master/docs/dictionary.
        xsd> in GitHub. See
        <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#definitions>.

        Default "count": *5*. Specify the number of results returned.

        Default "partOfSpeech": *empty*. Specify one or many part-of-speech
        types for which to return definitions. Pass multiple types as an
        array reference.

        The available partOfSpeech values are:

            [noun, verb, adjective, adverb, idiom, article, abbreviation, preposition, prefix, interjection, suffix]

    examples($word)
        You can retrieve 5 example sentences for a words in Wordnik's alpha
        corpus. Each example contains the source document and a source URL,
        if it exists. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#examples>.

        $word is the word to look up.

    related($word, %args)
        You retrieve related words for a particular word. See
        <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#relateds>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "type": *empty*. Return one or many relationship types. Pass
        multiple types as an array reference.

        The available type values are:

            [synonym, antonym, form, equivalent, hyponym, variant]

    frequency($word)
        You can see how common particular words occur in Wordnik's alpha
        corpus, ordered by year. See

        See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#punc>.

        $word is the word to look up.

    suggest($word, %args)
        The autocomplete service gives you the opportunity to take a word
        fragment (start of a word) and show what other words start with the
        same letters. The results are based on corpus frequency, not static
        word lists, so you have access to more dynamic words in the
        language. See <http://docs.wordnik.com/api/methods#auto>.

        $word is the word to look up. %args accepts:

        Default "count": *5*. Specify the number of results returned.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    System::Wrapper requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires the core modules "Test::More", "version" and
    "Carp", and "LWP::UserAgent" from "CPAN". Additionally, it
    recommends-requires "JSON" from "CPAN" for getting data in Perl data
    structures.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.

    Response headers are not checked for 404s, etc. Likewise, response data
    is not post-processed in any way, other than optionally being parsed
    from "JSON" to "Perl" data structures. Data::Dumper should be of help
    there.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-www-wordnik-api@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org>.

TODO
    Error checking
        Implement basic HTTP error checking on response headers.

    Post-processing
        Add filtering methods on response data.
